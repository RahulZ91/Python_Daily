The capitalize() method in Python is used to change the first letter of a string to uppercase and make all other letters lowercase. It is especially useful when we want to ensure that text follows title-like capitalization, where only the first letter is capitalized.
eg: s = "hello WORLD"
res = s.capitalize()
print(res)

Python String split() method splits a string into a list of strings after breaking the given string by the specified separator.
eg: string = "one,two,three"
words = string.split(',')
print(words)


Capitalise each first letter in the string
1. split the string to a list
2. capitalise each element of the list
3. join the list to a string
4. print

# Complete the solve function below.
def solve(s):
    x=s.split()
    res = ' '.join([str(s).capitalize() for s in x])
    return res
